			<h1>Viacoin Copay Privacy Policy</h1>

			<h2>Scope and Consent</h2>
			<p>
				This notice describes the ways the Viacoin project and its subsidiaries (“Viacoin,” “we,” “our” or “us”) collect, store, use and protects a user’s (“User(s),” “you,” or “your”) personal information. The purpose of this notice is to ensure that Viacoin complies with applicable United States (US) federal and state regulations, and European Union (EU) data protection laws, and ensures that users are provided privacy protection. There is one type of user whose personal information we may process:
			</p>		
			<ul>
				<li>Users that download and use our Products.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Users accept this Policy by visiting our website and/or by using our Products.
			</p>

			<h2>What is “personally identifiable information?”</h2>
			<p>
				“Personally identifiable information” (“personal information”) is any information that can be directly associated with a particular person and can be used to identify that person. A prime example of identifiable information is a person’s name. In some instances, such as the EU directive, an email or IP address can be viewed as personal information.
			</p>

			<h2>What information we do collect</h2>
			<p>
				Viacoin does not collect users personal information unless the user enables “email notifications.” Once a user selects “Enable email notifications” in the settings section of the product, Viacoin will store a user’s email address on our servers. If enabled, Viacoin could have access to view the balance and transaction history of a wallet and link it to a user’s email address. Lastly, Viacoin always keeps access logs to our servers, which contain IP address, time, access details.
				Viacoin does not collect any third party integrations within the product (such as Viacoin exchange or any other integrations). It is crucial to note that private keys are never transmitted to Viacoin’s servers, so it is not possible for Viacoin to access a user’s viacoin in any case.
			</p>

			<h2>Why we collect email addresses</h2>
			<p>
				Our primary purpose for collecting an email address is to provide you with a secure, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. We may use your email address to:
				send notices about your transactions.
			</p>

			<h2>How we protect and store personal information</h2>
			<p>
				We store and process your email address on our computers in Europe and we protect it by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable US federal and state regulations, and EU data protection laws.
				We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.
			</p>

			<h2>How we share personal information with third parties</h2>
			<p>
				We may share your personal information with:
			</p>			
			<ul>
				<li>
				other Viacoin entities, to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to guide decisions about our products, services, and communications;
				</li>
				<li>
				law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other legal process or requirement applicable to Viacoin; or when we believe, in our sole discretion, that the disclosure of an email address is necessary to report suspected illegal activity or to investigate violations of our Terms of Use.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>	
				Please note that these third parties may be in other countries where the laws on processing personal information may be less stringent than in your country.
			</p>

			<h2>Marketing</h2>
			<p>
				We do not sell your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize the Viacoin Services, content, and advertising. If you do not wish to receive marketing communications from us or participate in our ad-customization programs, you can just click the “unsubscribe” link in the e-mail, or you can send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@viacoin.org">info@viacoin.org</a>.
				Changes to this notice
				We may amend this notice at any time by posting a revised version on the product’s notice page. The revised version will be effective at the time we post it. Also, if the revised version includes any substantial changes to the manner in which your personal information will be processed, we will provide you with 30 days prior notice by posting notification of the change on the “Privacy Notice” area of our product.
			</p>

			<h2>Questions about privacy? Please contact us.</h2>
			<p>
				If you have questions concerning this Privacy Notice, please feel free to send us an email at <a href="mailto:info@viacoin.org">info@viacoin.org</a>.
